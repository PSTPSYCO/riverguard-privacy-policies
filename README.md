Privacy Policy for RiverGuard

Effective Date: December 4, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how ("we," "us," or "our") handles information collected from users ("you") of the RiverGuard mobile application (the "App").

1. Information We Collect

Our primary goal is to provide real-time water quality data for the nearest monitoring station. To achieve this, we collect and process the following limited types of information:

A. Personal Data: Precise Geolocation Data

When you use the Nearest Location feature of the App, we request and collect your device's precise location (using GPS or network location services).

B. Non-Personal Data

We collect non-personal data related to the performance and operation of the App, including network connectivity status and error reports, which helps us ensure stability.

2. How We Use the Information

A. Geolocation Data

The precise geolocation data collected is used solely for the following purpose:

To calculate the distance between your current location and the available water quality monitoring stations.

To identify and display the closest monitoring station and its related data (WQI score, parameters, historical trend).

We do not store, track, or share your precise location data on our own servers. This information is processed ephemerally (momentarily) on your device to serve the nearest station result, and is not retained by us after the calculation is complete.

B. Other Data

Network status and connection configuration data are used exclusively to manage data fetching from the water quality database API.

3. Data Security and Retention

Retention: We do not retain any Personal Data (like your geolocation) that we process. Non-personal device connection data is processed ephemerally or retained only as aggregated performance metrics through third-party services.

Security: We are committed to protecting the integrity and confidentiality of your data. All data communication between the App and the external water quality API is transmitted over secure, encrypted channels (HTTPS/SSL).

4. Third-Party Services

The App relies on third-party services that may collect information used to operate the App, as dictated by their own privacy policies.

Google Play Services: The App uses the built-in services of your device, such as the location services provided by Google (via the Geolocator library), to obtain your GPS coordinates. These services operate under Google's Privacy Policy.

External Data API: The App fetches public water quality data from a government or institutional API. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of this external data provider.

5. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
